Bloccit was my second Bloc Project using Ruby on Rails.  It is a reddit replica that allows has various authorization levels for users.  At the highest authorization level users can create topics, makes posts about a topic, and comment on posts.  Users can also up vote, down vote, and favorite posts.  Users receive emails containing comments on posts they favorite and each user has his own profile page.
